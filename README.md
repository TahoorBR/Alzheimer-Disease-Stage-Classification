Studying  Alzheimer Disease and its 6 different stages using Machine Learning/ Classification

**Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)** identifies as a major unsolved nerve deterioration disease based on its insidious beginning and advancing. Here, the subset of the ADNI Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database is used, with the aim of making diagnosis faster and more accurate by leveraging machine learning technologies. By integrating brain MRI data, cognitive scores, demographic variables and genetic risk factors I have developed a model that could divide the patients into the six categories characterizing the progression of AD. This was done by data preprocessing, model selection based on performance metrics, accuracy, precision, and so on, the same as the validation process. Evidence has demonstrated the success of machine learning in guiding diagnosis of the very early stage of dementia and, in the process they seem to be able to correct many of the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods in speed and non-invasiveness.
